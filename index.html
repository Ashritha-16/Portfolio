  <button class="collapsible">Life is Like a Cricket Game</button>
  <div class="content">
Life is like a cricket game,
Each role we play is not the same.

As a batter, face each ball,
"Hit your goals or stand tall."

As a bowler, aim with care,
"Focus on your target; you’ll get there."

As a fielder, watch and wait,
"Grab the chances that come your way."

As an umpire, choose what’s right,
"Your decisions can change the fight."

Play your part with all your heart,
Life, like cricket, is a work of art.

  <button class="collapsible">Siva is Everything</button>
  <div class="content">
Siva is powerful, strong, and true.
Siva is patience, calm like night.
Siva is truth, yet also deep.
Siva is pure, eternal, and boundless.

Siva is breath, the essence of life.
Siva is the soul, beyond all sight.
Siva is life, and Siva is death.
Siva is love, forever bright.

Siva is time, the past, present, and future.
Siva is start, Siva is end.
Siva is everything, near and far.
Siva is Lord of Lords, divine and wise.

Siva is earth, steady and strong.
Siva is sky, vast and free.
Siva is air, soft yet grand.
Siva is water, pure and deep.
Siva is fire, brave and bright.

Siva is Shakthi, the endless force.
Siva is Bhakthi, the soul’s true course.
Siva is Maya, the illusion and the reality.
Siva is magic, the unseen divine play.

Siva is victory, fearless and bold.
Siva is failure, yet never controlled.

When there is nothing, Siva is everything.

Har Har Mahadev!

  <button class="collapsible">The Gentle Side of Overthinking</button>
  <div class="content">
Sometimes, overthinking is kind,
It takes me far from my restless mind.
It lifts me away from the pain I truly feel,
And helps my heart slowly heal.
  </div>

  <button class="collapsible">The Hope Within Dark</button>
  <div class="content">
Darkness is something no one wants to face.
But without dark, there can be no hope for light.

Dark gives us hope—
that when it comes,
light will surely follow.

If dark were a color,
in the form of strength, it is Kali.
In the form of courage, it is Shiva.
In the form of love, it is Krishna.

Dark is not just about the absence of light;
it is the symbol of the unseen,
of nothingness we cannot know or touch.
It marks the beginning—reminding us
that even in nothingness, there is dark,
and even in dark, there is silence—
a silence that gives us hope for a new beginning.

Dark is not ordinary.
It is the hope for tomorrow,
the courage to face it,
and the strength to fight for the light.

  <button class="collapsible">He Doesn’t Know</button>
  <div class="content">
He thinks he sees me, but he doesn’t know how much I wish he’d truly notice me.

He thinks he smiles at me, but he doesn’t know how much I crave seeing him smile. 

He thinks he talks to me, but he doesn’t know how deeply I long for the day he truly speaks to me.

He thinks I’m just another girl he knows, but he doesn’t know he’s the only one I want in my life.

He doesn’t know that every moment, my heart waits—to see him, to talk to him, to be with him.

  <button class="collapsible">Places, People, and Stories</button>
  <div class="content">
In life, we travel to different places
and meet people with unique thoughts, beliefs, and dreams.

Some places feel comfortable,
while others may not.

Some teach us valuable lessons,
and some give us precious memories.

Some places bring friends who touch our hearts.
Every place holds a story
that stays with us forever.

While some places are easy to leave,
Others are difficult, 
because we can carry only memories,
not the places themselves.

In every place we visit, we meet people:
someone who makes life easier,
someone who values and respects us,
someone who helps us discover who we truly are,
someone who shows us the meaning of love,
someone who teaches us how to love, and
someone who reveals the true worth of friendship.

Some places give only memories,
but others gift both people and memories,
Each memory holds a beautiful story 
that words cannot capture
one that can only be felt and experienced.

It is not the places we remember,
or the paths we have walked,
but the hearts we have touched,
the love we have shared,
and the stories we carry inside
always with us, always ours.

  <button class="collapsible">Decisions and Destiny</button>
  <div class="content">
One day, a person asked another, “If you could choose to be a loser or a winner, what would you choose?” He said, “I would choose to be a winner.”

Then he asked, “If you were already a loser, would you stay the same or choose to be a winner?” He said, “I would choose to be a winner.”

Finally, he asked, “If you were already a winner, would you stay a winner or become a loser?” Again, he said, “I would choose to stay a winner.”

This shows that the person always chose to be a winner, but his situation each time was different. 
    
Sometimes we have many choices. Sometimes only one. And sometimes we just want to keep what we have. Everyone’s path in life is different, even if the goal is the same.
Because decisions are not taken for the future, todays decisions make the future
    
Right or wrong, every decision we make, based on where we are and what we face, moves us forward. Not today, not tomorrow, but one day, all those decisions will take us to our destination.

  <button class="collapsible">In Your Presence</button>
  <div class="content">
When I see you, my heart races.

When I'm beside you, my breath slows.

Your look of love lights up my life, and your smile fills my soul with joy.

A simple word from you freezes my world in that perfect moment.

Every time I see you, I long to see you more, to talk to you, to spend time with you.

If not a lifetime, then at least a moment, a moment so precious that it becomes part of my last seven minutes.

  <button class="collapsible">The Way of Accepting</button>
  <div class="content">
In the phase of accepting everything,
Accepting that it does not belong to me.
Accepting that what I want is not what I want. 
Accepting that those I love do not love me back. 

Accepting that I am alone.
Accepting that I feel unworthy.
Accepting that I am not important in the lives of those who are important to me.
Accepting that the love I give to someone is given to someone else.

Accepting that no one may treat me the way I treat them.
Accepting that everything can sometimes feel like nothing.

Yet even in this phase, one hope remains:
Everything I am accepting is for my own good.

Acceptance is not about how we look at things —
It is about the freedom it brings.
When you accept things as they are, you will find peace.

Whether you accept it or not —
Acceptance is the way of living.

  <button class="collapsible">True Love Always Finds Its Way</button>
  <div class="content">
She saw him for the first time on an ordinary day, unaware that he would become the most important person in her life. At first, he was just another face in the crowd. But something about him felt different, maybe it was the way he carried himself, the depth in his eyes, or the kindness in his voice when he spoke to others.

As days passed, she found herself looking for him. She longed to hear his voice, even if only in passing. Yet, she could never gather the courage to speak to him. Instead, she created a world of her own, a world where he was close, where they talked endlessly, where her love for him was free and fearless. It was a love she never dared to express, yet it grew stronger with every glance, every fleeting moment they shared.

Then one day, as if fate had finally heard her silent prayers, he spoke to her. Just a simple conversation, nothing extraordinary, but to her, it was magic. In that moment, she felt like the happiest girl in the world. Everything else faded — the noise, the people, the world — until only his voice remained.

As time went on, they became friends. Their conversations grew longer, their laughter more familiar. She cherished every moment, but still, there was something she couldn’t say. The words remained locked in her heart, trapped by the fear of losing what little they had.

And then, that fear deepened the fear of losing him completely.

She wanted to be close to him, but couldn’t hold his gaze for too long. She longed to pour her heart out, but the words never came. She wished to understand his feelings, but was too afraid to ask.

Maybe this was love, too — the feeling that lives in the space between wanting and waiting, between holding on and letting go. 

And so, she waited.

Time passed. They both left to chase their dreams. Life moved on, but somehow, fate brought them back together. When they saw each other again, something had changed, but something had remained exactly the same.

They stared at each other for a while, then began to talk, as if no time had passed. She realised her feelings hadn’t faded. They grew closer again, and they began talking regularly. But even now, she couldn’t bring herself to express what she felt. 

Then, one fine day, he invited her for coffee. They met at a quiet cafe. When she looked into his eyes, she sensed something different.

After spending time together, he finally said the words she had waited so long to hear:

“Will you marry me?”

Her world stopped. The wait of all those years, the silent prayers, the quiet hope, all of it came rushing back. She couldn’t believe it. Then he began to tell his story.

At first, she hadn’t meant much to him. But over time, he had started to admire her from afar, quietly. Still, he had chosen to focus on his career, on his family. He never knew how she felt, and he didn’t want to risk hurting her or losing his focus. 

But whenever they spoke, he felt like she was the one. Whenever he looked into her eyes, he felt his world shift. So he waited, hoping that when the time was right, the universe would bring them back together.

Hearing this, she was filled with joy. Words failed her. But in that moment, nothing is needed. They understood each other completely.

Now, they are happy, two souls who waited patiently, who believed in love without expectations, who trusted that the universe would bring them together. They didn’t know they were loving each other all these years. But they believed in the process, and in time.

Because true love doesn’t rush. True love waits. And when the time is right, everything falls into place. Because true love always finds its way.
